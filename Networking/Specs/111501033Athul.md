# MASTI COMMUNICATION MODULE
# DATA STATUS NOTIFIER
Developer: Athul.M.A (111501033)

### Introduction
The Communication module receives send requests from the other modules which attempt to send a packet like Messaging, Image Processing module etc. Communication module attempts to send these packets but the procedure may fail due to many reasons. The aim of the Data Status Notifier is to notify the module that sent the packet whether the packet was sent successfully or not.
### Used by

  - **ICommunication Interface** - **subscribeForDataStatus**  function in the interface is used by the Image Processing and Messaging modules to subscribe for the status and pass their handlers to the Communication module
  - **Data Outgoing component of the Communication module** - This component uses the Data Status Notifier to send the corresponding module, the status of the packet

### Component Signatures
#### Datatypes used
1. Datatype to indicate status of the packet
```
enum StatusCode
{
    Success,
    Failure
} 
```
2. Datatype that tracks the module the packet came from
```
enum DataType
{
    Message,
    ImageSharing
} 
```
#### Event Handlers

  **public delegate void DataStatusHandler( ulong dataID, StatusCode status );** - This is an event handler function that is executed whenever the event occurs. Here the events are status updates to a module. Each module should define its own handler whose signature should match the above signature. The handler is passed to the communication module while subscribing for status updates.
 
  
#### Function Signatures
```
bool SubscribeForDataStatus(DataType type, DataStatusHandler handler);
void DataStatusNotify(DataType moduleType, StatusCode status, ulong dataID);
```

#### Function Descriptions

**SubscribeForDataStatus** - This function subscribes the corresponding module calling the function to receive the status updates for which datatype is the argument '**type**'. Whenever such a status event is encountered **handler** is called.

**DataStatusNotify** - This function is called by the Data Outgoing Component of the Communication module with the required arguments. It triggers the corresponding event for the module of ***type*** and  for the packet whose ID is "**DataID**"

#### Workflow

- Modules subscribe for status updates by calling **SubscribeForDataStatus** function in the **ICommunication** interface. 
- After the Data Outgoing component attempts to send a packet, the success or failure of the operation denoted by the datatype **StatusCode** is sent to the **DataStatusNotifier** through **DataStatusNotify** function along with the ID and origin module of the packet.
- The **DataStatusNotify** function identifies the packet origin module and calls the corresponding event handler given at subscription of the module.
