# OBJECTIVE:
To implement the client-side start/stop/resend screen sharing.

## Interface
```csharp
public interface IImageProcessingClient
{
    public bool StartScreenSharing(IPaddress targetIP, uint timeInterval = 3000);
    public bool StopSharing();
    public bool Resend(IPaddress targetIP);
}
```
## Start Screen Sharing:
---
### Dependencies:
- Inter team:
    - Schema team.
    - Networking team.
- Intra team:
    - Compression class.
### Class
```csharp
public class ImageProcessingClient : IImageProcessingClient
```
### Method
```csharp
private static bool stopSharing = false;
private static int imageID = 0;
public bool StartScreenSharing(IPaddress targetIP, uint timeInterval = 3000)
{
    // check all parameters consistency i.e. they are within the range.
    // create a static variable for id.
    //Inside the asynchronous block.
        // capture the whole screen.
		// create the compression class object.
        //call the compressor function then encode the String and finally publish to Networking.
		Compression compress= new Compression();
        Dictionary<int, Bitmap> compressedImage = Compression.Compress(currentScreenShot, true);  //true for implementing diff compression.
		//convert the dictionary<int,Bitmap> to object and store it in a variable named <obj>.
        string encodedImage = Schema.Encode(obj);
        if(stopSharing == false)
        {
			// get the communicator object.
            Communicate.Send(encodedImage, id, targetIP, "ImageSharing");  // I didnot got why i need to send "ImageSharing".
        }
        else
        {
            // free the memory alloted and exit.
        }
        // wait for 'timeInterval' period of time.
}
```
#### Explaination:
- I will subscribe to `SignalStartSharing()` which will be written by team member Axel.
- After being invoked, it will start capturing screenshot and ask for compression and encoding and publish the encoded string to networking team every fixed time interval till `StopSharing()` is called.
- Below is the step-wise approach:
	- It will assign a new imageID to each variable
	- It will create a global static variable to store the previousScreenshot 
	- It will create a asynchronuous block.
	- Inside a block:
		- It will take a screenshoot (It will be a bitmap object).
		- Call the compressor function with the got bitmap object and it will return dictionary<int, Bitmap> type.
		- Call the schema encode api with the got dict and it will return string.
		- Publish the got string to Networking team.
		- Wait for given period of time.

## Stop Screen Sharing:
---
### Dependencies:
- Inter team:
    - None.
- Intra team:
    - None.
### Class
```csharp
public class ImageProcessingClient : IImageProcessingClient
```
### Method
```csharp
public bool StopSharing() //to stop the screensharing.
{
    stopSharing = true;
}
```
#### Explaination:
- This function will subscribe to `SignalStopSharing()` implemented to Axel.
- Will set the bool stopSharing static variable to true.

## Resend:
---
### Dependencies:
- Inter team:
    - Schema team.
    - Networking team.
- Intra team:
    - Compression class.
### Class
```csharp
public class ImageProcessingClient : IImageProcessingClient
```
### Method
```csharp
public bool Resend(IPaddress targetIP)
{
    // Get the id.
    // capture the whole screen.
    // call the compressor function (WITHOUT implementing diff) then encode the String and finally publish to Networking.
	Compression compress= new Compression();
    Dictionary<int, Bitmap> compressedImage = Compression.Compress(currentScreenShot, true);  //true for implementing diff compression.
	//convert the dictionary<int,Bitmap> to object and store it in a variable named <obj>.
    string encodedImage = Schema.Encode(obj);
    if(stopSharing == false)
    {
        Communicate.Send(encodedImage, id, targetIP, "ImageSharing");  // I didnot got why i need to send "ImageSharing".
    }
    else
    {
        // free the static variable 
    }
}
```
#### Explaination:
- This function will subscribe to `SignalResend()` which is implemented by team member Axel.
- This function will capture the fresh screenshot with fresh ID and send it immediately to server once.
- This function will stop executing if stopSharing variable is set to true or if it sent a fresh image.
