## Receive Data
---
### Classname
#### _**ImageProcessing.Server.RecieveData**_
### Overview
When server's networking module recieves the client's screen it would be sending it to ImageProcessing modules. signalling class of ImageProcess is the closest layer to network which will be getting the message and transferring it to lower level of ImageProcessing module. RecieveData would be subscribed to signal class. After getting the raw bit string of image from signalling, ReceiveData would be calling the schema to get proper formatted dictionary(<image>bitmap, <error> errormsg,<diff> bitmap, <clientip> ipAddrs). If no error message is found then it will be instantiating Decompression object otherwise it would publishing error message and client ip to UI module. Upon getting correct format of image it would be publishing it to UI module with image and ip of client address.

### Dependencies:
- Inter module:
    - UI module
    - Schema module.
- Intra class:
    - Signalling class
    - Compression class
#### DataMember
- (-)RawString- this will be set by the signalling class
- (-)ImageDictionary- schema team will be returning this datamember
- (-)CompressionClassObject- instantiating the class compression object by passing the imageDictionary as arguement.
- (-)ImageBitmap- returned from the decompression class methods
- (-)UIobject- for publisher subscriber relationhip with UI
#### Methods
- (+)setRawString- method to set the rawString by signalling
- (-)getSchema- method to get the proper format dictionary fromt the schema module. 
- (-)getDecompressedImage- This instantiate the object of compression class.
- (-)diffImage- calls the diff method of CompressionClassObject to get the new bitmap image
- (-)publishUI- publishes required input (image and ClientIp) or (error and ClientIpip) to the UI module
### Testing
checking the proper functioning of methods defined in the class.

## Stop Screen Sharing:
---
### Classname
#### _**ImageProcessing.Server.StopSharedScreen**_
### Overview
Stop Screen Sharing class would be subscribing to UI module for Stopping the screen share. After getting the message it has to deallocate the resources by talking to the recieveData class and send message to signal class to notify the networking module to close the connection.   
### Dependencies:
- Inter module:
    - UI module
- Intra class:
    - ReceiveData class
    - Signalling class
#### DataMember
- (-)StopScreen-varible which is cleared initially would be set by the UI team.
- (-)SignalObject- publishing to signalling class through this data member.
- (-)RecieveDataObject- takes the current object and keeps it for destroying purpose after stopSharing is called.
#### Methods
- (+)setStopScreen- method to set the stopScreen datamember by UI module to stop everything.(subscription method)
- (-)sendSignal- once StopScreen variable is set it publishes signalling class about stop screen sharing.
- (-)Destroy-destroys every object and thereads created for that recieving session.
### Testing
checking the proper functioning of methods defined in the class.

## Testing Server functions
---
### Classname
#### _**ImageProcessing.Server.Test**_
### Overview
In server side _**getSharedScreen**_ and _**StopSharingScreen**_ are the methods to start image processing and stop it from the server side. This class offers method to check their proper functioning.
### Dependencies:
- TestInterface module
#### Methods
- testGetShareScreen- checks proper functioning using networking module.
- testStopSharing- Check proper functioning by getting feedback from networing module and Check if the threads are destroyed after calling StopSharing
