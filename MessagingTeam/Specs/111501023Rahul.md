# Code Specification - Constructor and Callbacks
By: Rahul Dhawan (111501023)

## Introduction:-
In the *constructor* the programm will be able to create an instance of the ICommunicate , ISchema and IPersist and in the *callbacks* when the message or status will come it will be able to send back to the *UX*.

***

## Objective:-
* Design and code Constructor.
* Design and code Callbacks.

***

## Design
* Constructor:
The Design is just simply to use *new* to create instance.
* Callbacks:
The callbacks are the functions used by Communication team for sending the message to ux team which we subscribed when the UX team will subscribed to us. we required two callbacks function:

1.) StatusCallback : This function will help in sending the status (Delivered or not) of the message to UX that UX already sent.

2.) DataCallback : This function will help in sending the message that will come for UX.      

***

## Pseudocode:-
* Code:

```csharp


Messager()
{

       //create an instance of Icommunicate
       
       comm = new @communicate_class_name
 
       schemaObj = new @schema_class_name
 
       persistObj = new @persistance_class_name
 
       //similarly  schemaObj,and persistanceObj
        
}

* Callbacks

public void StatusCallback(enum dataType,String messageId)
{

      // datatype will hold the status and messageId for which message the status corresponds to.
}

public void DataCallback(String message,String Ipaddres)
{

      // message will hold the encoded message which i will decode using persistnce team and Ipaddress will contain from where it is coming.
}
```
